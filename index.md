## Example C++ Code

Here's a simple C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include the iostream library for input/output operations

int main() {
    // Print "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by a newline
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;

    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
